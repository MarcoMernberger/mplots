## TODO list.

- [ ] separate all plot functions from the jobs encapsulating them
- [ ] create modules that can work alone, e.g. in a jupyter environment
- [ ] create a new module jobs that handles all job encapsulation
- [ ] in a later step, refactor this into a new package
- [ ] write test cases for all plots
